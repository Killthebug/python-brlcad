This is the python version of wdb_example.c using the python-brlcad module.

usage:

    python wdb_example.py output.g

    # want to render to file?
    rtedge -s 1024 -F output.pix output.g box_n_ball.r
    pix-png -s 1024 < output.pix > output.png

wdb_example.c header text:

    Create a BRL-CAD geometry database from C code.

    Note that this is for writing (creating/appending) a database.

    Note that since the values in the database are stored in millimeters, the
    arguments to the mk_* routines are constrained to also be in millimeters.
